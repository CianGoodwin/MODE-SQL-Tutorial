# MODE-SQL-Tutorial


This repository contains my solutions to the practice questions that are located throughout the [Mode Analytics SQL Tutorial](https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/introduction-to-sql). The tutorial is broken down into three sections Basic, Intermediate and Advanced. 

## Structure
- [`/basic.sql`](https://github.com/CianGoodwin/MODE-SQL-Tutorial/blob/main/basic.sql) – SELECT statements, filtering, sorting, aggregates, Comparison operators, Logical operators.
- `/intermediate.sql` – Aggregate Functions, Joins, Unions, and Self joins.
- `/advanced.sql` – Data Wrangling, Subqueries, Windows Functions, Pivots. 

## Datasets
The file [`/datasets/`](https://github.com/CianGoodwin/MODE-SQL-Tutorial/tree/main/datasets) contains the csv file for each data set that was used throughout the tutorial.
